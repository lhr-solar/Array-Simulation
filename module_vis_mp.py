File Description:
This is a visualization of the solution space to the surface constraint problem.
We have a set of modules where the current for each module can be modeled very
loosely given the voltage as V^2 + I^2 = 1 (1st quadrant of the unit circle).
We find the list of N-dimensional coordinate candidates that match the following
constraint functions:

F(V1, V2, ..., Vn) = V1 + V2 + ... + Vn = V_total
Additionally, Vk <= V_max.

In layman terms, we want to find the set of solutions where the individual
voltages sum to V_total and visualize their minimum current output (the reason
being that a set of modules in series is current limited by the worst module).

3rd Plot. A 2D graph (with 3 overlapping datasets) representing the min
current as a function of THREE independent module voltages.
The color of the points represent the current magnitude and the two

Voltage range is constrained by the constraint function.
